# Qualitative-Activity-Recognition


Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. In this project the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercises.
